This is a repository where I store the results following the lectures of an online course about neural networks by Andrej Karpathy. This course can be found in https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ. The objective of the course consists on developping a language model using neural networks that will be trained to become a text generator. Specifically, in this project we train the model with real human names and it generates new ones that sound human-like, at least to some extent :^). Below you can find the outputs that the project generates after every lecture.
